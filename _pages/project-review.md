  Project review for HIST 4261/5261: Working With Data
---

This is my project review on the [Historic Streetcars of Colorado](https://cdot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=3e33bb458ab54c6086556fd4a320449a). It was written on {{ page.date }} and falls under the category of: {{ page.category }}.

# Argument and Interpretation

This GIS-powered Storymap assembled by the Colorado Department of Transportation provides an interactive look into all of the various streetcars that were in operation in Colorado from the mid 19th century up until the interwar period. The main argument I have deciphered from this online exhibit highlights the importance of these early public transit routes in the economic development of these individual towns and Colorado as a whole, as well as a more implicit argument in favor of public transit and the impacts of the decline of readily available and effective service throughout our state. I thought the scope being statewide was effective at emphasizing the wide range of types of streetcars in our state, from the small mining towns to the booming cities. One aspect that I perceived was a lack of more qualitative data, with little to no expansion on more descriptors or first hand accounts, beyond a timeline. There were a handful of pictures as well, but would have loved to see more and to see them better implemented in the website.

# Data and Evidence

This project was completed in 2020, a collaboration between the Colorado Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, and the City and County of Denver. Much of the data comes from a variety of governmental sources, with the majority of the data being either from their archives, or otherwise collected, with all of it being assembled, and repackaged by the Colorado Department of Transportation for use for educators, historians, or otherwise public transit nerds. A large majority of the qualitative data such as the timelines and photographs were pulled from a report produced by Mead and Hunt, Arch Professionals, and AECOM for CODOT, and the GIS data is available if the user wants to reach out to the email provided. The data is incredibly interactable as well, which is a huge plus for the dataset, as it allows for the end user to do an even deeper dive into stuff they might find interesting, such as a line or building that was in their neighborhood, or a mining town that boomed in the time period of the streetcar.

# Organization and Design

One of the largest advantages of a site like this when exploring a topic such as public transit, is that it allows for an incredible sense of freedom while exploring the data. The top row of tabs allows someone to zoom directly to their home or favorite mountain town, but the map works just like any popular map viewer, such as Google or Apple Maps, so the end user can scroll around to their heart’s content, ranging from ultra zoomed in looking at individual neighborhoods and streets, all the way to seeing how the streetcar would travel between Denver and Boulder, and Golden, and how that mirrors today’s RTD layout. The organization of this site has many pros, although I will say I had some troubles with the informative sidebar getting in the way while trying to analyze specific data. Although this is getting into nitpicking, an issue I had with the project is the difficulties of finding one of the most interesting parts of this project, which uses the ability of GIS software to overlay spatial data on old photographs, like CODOT did with Denver in this project. The basemap of 1933 Denver is hidden away at the bottom of the basemap tab, within the toolbox on the upper right hand side of the screen, when it should be an option as soon as any user clicks on the Denver tab, as seeing Denver at that time in a visual way really highlights the usefulness of these streetcars.

# Communication and Audience

With a project such as this one, finding the target audience can be somewhat tricky, as this database has many uses in our world. For one, it can help tell a story of the history of Colorado, so educators, journalists, and new media can effectively utilize many aspects of this website to tell a story of personal freedom, capitalism, and change. On the other hand, the database being available for anyone and everyone allows it to be used as a basis of further research studies, whether they be academic or personal, surrounding the spatial features presented in this dataset. Implementation of this data can be used in many ways, such as comparing to modern transit routes with bus or trains, looking at historical and modern demographic data to analyze the effects of these streetcars, and much, much more. The effectiveness of the data is obvious when a 13 year old and a cartographer working on their masters thesis could get equal enjoyment and use out of this site. This project has inspired me to create a useful and visually stimulating piece of historical work like this one.
